## :books: Description

- We rely on the global **community** to express and understand the meta language being made.
- We have **accessibility** by having a language that trancends the natural languages, emoji.
  Using this people can express without directly talking to each other.
- There is a sense of **sustainability** by promoting unknown local areas.

* The development tools used to build the project;
- We use React for the front end with Google Maps using Material UI, with data seeded from
  users using Python.
