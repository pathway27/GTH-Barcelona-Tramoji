## :books: Description

We are a mix of all three in this way:
- We use Accessibility by having a language that trancends the natural languages, emoji.
  Using this people can express without directly talking to each other.
- We rely on the community to express and understand the meta language being made.

* Hackathon topic you used (Sustainability, Accessibility or Community);
* The development tools used to build the project;
- We use React for the front end with Google Maps, with data seeded from
  users using Python.
- We use Material UI
