## :books: Description

- We rely on the global **community** to express and understand the meta language being created.
- We account for **accessibility** by having a language that transcends the natural ones: emoji. In this way, people can express without any language barriers.
- There is a sense of **sustainability** by promoting unknown local areas and redistributing mass tourism from main hubs.

Development tools used to build the project:
- We use React for the front end with Google Maps using Material UI, with data seeded from users using Python. Additionally, we use Dialogflow as a natural language processor for the development of conversation interfaces, with Kommunicate serving as a provider for the chatbot UI.
